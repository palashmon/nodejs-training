## Sinon.JS

[Sinon.JS](https://sinonjs.org/) is a standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript. Works with any unit testing framework.

Sinon splits test-doubles into three types:

- **Spies** — which offer information about function calls, without affecting their behavior
- **Stubs** — which are like spies, but completely replace the function. This makes it possible to make a stubbed function do whatever you like — throw an exception, return a specific value, etc
- **Mocks** — which make replacing whole objects easier by combining both spies and stubs
